/*
    Almost every sorting algorithm are example of divide and conquer

    What is divide and conquer?
    1. Multi-branched recursion:
     our recursive func can call itself, once or multiple times in every single recusive call

    2. Break a problem into multiple smaller but same sub-problems

    3. Combines the solution of sub-problems into the solution for the original problem
