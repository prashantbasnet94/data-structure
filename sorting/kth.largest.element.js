[2,3,1,2,4,2] => [1,2,2,2,3,4]                       |   
when k = 4 we return 4rth largest element i.e 2 [1,2,2,2,3,4]

Verify the constraints:


1. Can we get an array wehere k is larger thabn the array length?
    No, answer is always available

2. Test Cases:

[5,7,8,2,4,1] => [1,2,4,5,7,8], k => 2 , i.e 7
[2,3,1,2,4,2] => [1, 2, 2 ,2, 3, 4], k = 3 , i.e 2
[3] k =1, 3
