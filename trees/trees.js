Trees are a data structure, that have what we call a hirarcical structure.

As oppose to linked list or arrays, which are linear, trees can have 0 or more child nodes.

Tree usually starts with a single root/parent node, and every child of the tree decends from the root node

Every child of a node decends from one parent
Parent child relationship is uni directional. You also have leaf nodes which are the very end  of the tree Data structure

Within a tree, you can have subtree

Our web pages are created by dom. Which is also a tree Data strcuture
Computer in chess used tree data strucutre, facebook comment is a tree data structure

The beauty of tree is that we use the same principal we did in linked list i.e nodes
These nodes can contain any type of information within the node, we can have user information, numbers. Anything we want we can contain within a node


Linked list is technically a type of tree, with just one single path which is linear, there's only one way to go from top to bottom
vs what we seen before. 

Things to keep in mind different than linked list
1. Node can only point to the child
2. There's only one entry point i.e root
3. Node don't really have to reference there parents

Just like in real life, there are many types of tree Data structures
There are differnt types of trees that we can have for a specific usecase
